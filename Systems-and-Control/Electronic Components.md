IC
http://blog.jayroboticsclub.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/how-ic-l293d-runs-a-motor.jpg
A device made of interconnected electronic components, such as transistors and resistors, that are etched or imprinted onto a tiny slice of a semiconducting material, such as silicon or germanium. An integrated circuit smaller than a fingernail can hold millions of circuits. Also called chip, microchip.

An electrical cell is a device that is used to generate electricity, or one that is used to make chemical reactions possible by applying electricity. Multiple cells can be placed together in order to create a battery.

Crossing of conductors and double junctions.
A crossing of conductor is where two conductions e.g. wires, cross over without connecting to each other. This is represented by there being no dot between the two wires.
A double junction is where a wire comes together with another wire and connects to it. This is symbolised by a dot on the intercetion
